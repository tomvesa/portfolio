                <h3>Coding Experienc</h3>
                <p>I started to learn creating website on Wordpress based websites. Then as our customer needed some more customisation I started to explore more and more stuff how to make changes within CSS files.
                </p>
                <p>Starting from this it was easy to look for beginners courses on html, then css and finaly on javascript. Since then I do feel it is time to dig more deep into these languages to get comfortable with them</p>
